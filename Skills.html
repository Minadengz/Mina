        <h3><blockquote>Skills</blockquote></h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am good at working in a team because I know how to communicate and help others.
            Teamwork is important because it allows people to share ideas and solve problems together.
            When I work with others, I make sure to listen carefully and respect their opinions. 
            I always try to be a helpful team member by doing my part and encouraging my teammates.
            <br><br>
            Listening is another skill that I have, and I always try to understand people’s feelings when they talk.
            I focus on their words and body language so I can respond in a kind and helpful way. This helps me build
            good relationships with friends, classmates, and coworkers. When I listen well, people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts with me.
            <br><br>
            Another skill I have is adapting to change, which means I can adjust to new situations without feeling too stressed.
            Change happens all the time, and I have learned to stay calm and find solutions when things don’t go as planned.
            If I need to learn something new, I stay positive and try my best to understand it.
            <br><br>
            I believe that teamwork, listening, and adapting to change are important skills that make me a better person.
            These skills help me work well with others and handle different situations in life.

        <h3><blockquote>Hobbies</blockquote></h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games, especially online games. 
            I enjoy playing FPS games like Valorant and GTA because they are exciting and challenging.
            These games require quick thinking, fast reflexes, and teamwork.
            <br><br>
            When I play, I focus on improving my skills and learning new strategies.
            I also enjoy playing with my friends because we can work together and have fun.
            Sometimes, I play to relax, while other times, I play to compete and challenge myself.
            Gaming helps me think quickly and make good decisions under pressure.
            <br><br>
            I also like open-world games where I can explore and try different activities.
            Playing video games is more than just fun—it helps me learn patience and problem-solving.
            I also enjoy talking to other players online and learning from them. Many online games have large communities where players share tips and experiences.
            <br><br>
            I have made new friends through gaming, and we often help each other get better at the game.
            I also like trying new games to see different gameplay styles and stories.
            Sometimes, I play solo to focus on my own skills, but I also enjoy team-based games where cooperation is important.
            <br><br>
            Gaming has been a big part of my life for a long time, and I always look forward to trying new games.
            It is a great way to relax, have fun, and connect with people who share the same interest.

        <h3><blockquote>Interests</blockquote></h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a strong interest in anime, online games, and music.
            Anime is interesting because it has great stories, colorful animation, and unique characters.
            I enjoy watching different types of anime, from action to comedy to drama. Each anime has something special that makes it fun to watch.
            <br><br>
            I also like how anime teaches life lessons and shows different emotions.
            Some anime have deep and complex stories that make me think.
            I also like how anime introduces me to Japanese culture and traditions.
            <br><br>
            Another interest of mine is online games, which allow me to have fun and meet new people.
            Playing games online lets me connect with others who enjoy the same things.
            I like learning new strategies and improving my skills in different games.
            Online games also help me work on my teamwork and communication.
            <br><br>
            Besides anime and games, I love listening to music.
            Music helps me relax when I am stressed and gives me energy when I need motivation.
            I enjoy different types of music depending on my mood.
            Sometimes, I listen to upbeat songs to feel happy, while other times, I listen to calm music to relax.
            <br><br>
            I also like finding new songs and artists to listen to.
            Music makes my daily life more enjoyable and helps me focus when I need to study or work.
            My interests in anime, online games, and music bring me happiness and keep me entertained every day.
